# Dictionary

This project takes user input in the following format:

Test number, text file to be read, string/s to be found
For example:
1, word-freq.txt, thisisadummyword

Test 1 checks if the text file contains and matching strings.

Test 2 checks how many times the string appears in the text file.

Test 3 checks if the string separated by a space are in the text file and then returns the number of occurrences.

Test 4 checks a second text file against the first to determine if there are any words in the new file that do not occur in the dictionary text file
and then returns them in a list.
For example:
4, word-freq.txt, checkme.txt

Test 5 returns the first 20 entries in the text file as well as their frequency in alphabetical order

Test 6 returns the 20 most frequently occurring words in the text file as well as their frequency in descending order
